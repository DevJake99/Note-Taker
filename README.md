As a busy student, I want to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of my responsibilities. I decided that the perfect way to do this was to crerate a note taker app that will allow me to practice using node, express, and other libraries to create a usefull appm that will also allow me to practice my code writing abilities.
